# Raftr Exercise

Welcome and congratulations on landing an interview with Raftr! On this exercise, we will be observing the way you solve problems so please be as vocal as possible – walk us through your train of thought.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## The Problem

On the search input, type the word "Hill" very fast. You will see a bunch of errors on the console, and not all the results have the string "Hill" on it – why is that? Can you fix it?

Also, can you separate the search box so that it'll be a reusable React component?
